Payload - A Starcraft 2 Map
By Mac Chapman

Payload is an awesome gametype from Team Fortress 2.  One team has a bomb on rails and has to try to push it to the other team's base.  If they get it there before a timer runs out, they win.  If not, they lose.

I thought it'd work really well in Starcraft, so I had a go at it.  I think there is a lot of scope for improvement, but I'm hoping that people will build on this.

It should be available on the SC2 EU servers - just seach for Payload and it should come up.
